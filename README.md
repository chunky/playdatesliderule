# A Slide Rule for the Playdate Handheld Game Console

## What?

It's a slide rule.

## Why?

Actually, I have something else in mind, and this is a precursor. Figured
I'd do this first, release the code to anyone curious, and worry about
the next thing next.

## What, Again?

PlayDate is this cute little game console that's surprisingly awesome:

Before you kids with your new fangled "phones" and "calculators", people
used slide rules to do maths: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule

## Why, Again?

Because slide rules are awesome.
